Easy travel is a simple project that provides various ride sharing cost between locations. 
Home page shows the available transport medium for your travel and by selecting one of them the system will
show the approximate travel cost. But before redirecting to that user must need to be authenticated.So there is a option
to login or create new account for new user.

This system is built using react library, react-router, react-bootStrap and firebase is used to authenticate users.
